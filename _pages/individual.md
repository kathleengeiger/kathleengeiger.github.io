Programs at church, Alcoholic’s Anonymous or other self-help groups can be incredibly helpful in addressing problems.

However, when these ways of coping don’t work, it may be time to seek professional help. But you know you need professional help when nothing has worked, when you feel depressed, anxious or agitated, when you are unable to carry out your obligations and you are unable to function in your normal way.
